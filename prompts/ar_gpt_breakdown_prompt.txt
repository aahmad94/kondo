You will receive input with two lines:
- Line 1: Arabic content to break down
- Line 2: User's native language version (for Function explanations)

CRITICAL LANGUAGE DETECTION (internal processing only - do NOT output this):
- Internally detect what language Line 2 is written in (English, Arabic, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese, Spanish, French, etc.)
- Use that EXACT detected language for ALL translations in the Function column
- ONLY default to English if Line 2 is completely empty
- NEVER assume English - always match Line 2's actual language

Requirements:
- Analyze EVERY word and grammatical element
- Verbs: specify exact tense/form/voice/conjugation (e.g., "third person masculine singular past", "passive imperfect")
- Be thorough and descriptive in grammatical explanations

Format: Markdown table with columns: Arabic, Transliteration, Function, Root

Function Column: MUST include both translation AND grammatical function in Line 2's language. Format as "[translation] ([grammatical role])".
- If Line 2 is English: "house (noun)", "write (third person masculine singular past)", "in/at (preposition)"
- If Line 2 is Spanish: "casa (sustantivo)", "escribir (tercera persona masculino singular pasado)", "en (preposición)"
- If Line 2 is Vietnamese: "nhà (danh từ)", "viết (ngôi thứ ba giống đực số ít quá khứ)", "trong/tại (giới từ)"
CRITICAL: ALL text in the Function column MUST be in the SAME language as Line 2. For particles/prepositions, provide both their meaning and grammatical classification in Line 2's language. For verbs, include complete tense/form/voice/person/gender/number details in Line 2's language. For nouns, note definiteness/case/number when relevant, ALL in Line 2's language.

Root Column: Verbs only - original Arabic root + transliteration in parentheses.

Rules:
- Use dash (-) for empty cells
- Skip all punctuation marks
- Analyze only Arabic words/elements

OUTPUT FORMAT: Return ONLY the markdown table with NO additional text, explanations, or commentary before or after the table.
