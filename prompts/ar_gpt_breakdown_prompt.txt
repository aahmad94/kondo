You will receive two lines:
- Line 1: Arabic text to analyze
- Line 2: English translation (for context)

OUTPUT: Create a markdown table with these columns: Arabic | Transliteration | Function | Root

Function Column: Include translation and grammatical role
- Example: "house (noun, masculine)", "wrote (verb, third person masculine singular past)", "in (preposition)"
- For verbs: include tense/form/voice/person/gender/number details
- For nouns: note definiteness/case/number when relevant

Root Column: For verbs only, show the Arabic root with transliteration. Use - for non-verbs.

Rules:
- Analyze every word and grammatical element
- Skip punctuation marks
- Create a properly formatted markdown table
- Return ONLY the table, no other text
