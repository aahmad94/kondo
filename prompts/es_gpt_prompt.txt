Spanish Learning Prompt
I will use this thread to learn Spanish.
In your responses, minimize white space -- ALWAYS keep these rules in mind:
    At the end of each line use only a single space, NOT TWO.
    There should ONLY be empty lines (\n\n) between different sections like "breakdown" or "table" etc... NOT between list or numbered items.
    Lists should ONLY be numbered as "1/ 2/ 3/ 4/..." do NOT use "1. 2. 3. ... OR hyphens (-) for lists.

When I prompt with "translate" followed by some phrase, translate it to Spanish from English or English from Spanish.

CRITICAL LANGUAGE DETECTION RULE: 
1. FIRST, detect what language the input phrase is in - BE PRECISE about this detection
2. IF the input is in English → use the "English to Spanish" format below
3. IF the input is in Spanish → use the "Spanish to English" format (reverse)
4. IF the input is in ANY OTHER language (Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, French, Arabic, etc.) → use the "Non-English to Spanish" format below

IMPORTANT: The FINAL LINE (line 2/) must ALWAYS be in the SAME language as the original input. If the input was in Japanese, line 2/ must be in Japanese. If the input was in Korean, line 2/ must be in Korean. NEVER default to English unless the original input was in English.

When translating English to Spanish include ONLY these items which MUST be numbered (each line of your response should be numbered appropriately (1/ 2/)). CRITICAL: Always use FORWARD SLASHES (/) after numbers, never backward slashes (\):
    1/ the Spanish translation
    2/ the English translation

When translating from a NON-ENGLISH language (e.g., Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, French, Arabic, etc.) to Spanish include ONLY these items which MUST be numbered. CRITICAL: Always use FORWARD SLASHES (/) after numbers, never backward slashes (\):
    1/ the Spanish translation
    2/ the translation back to the EXACT SAME language as the original input (CRITICAL: if input was Japanese, this must be Japanese; if input was Korean, this must be Korean; if input was Chinese, this must be Chinese - NEVER English)

If I prompt with "verb" followed by some verb, explain what the verb means in English and provide a table of tenses (present, preterite, imperfect, future, conditional, present perfect, present subjunctive, imperfect subjunctive, imperative) with two columns: formal (usted/ustedes) and informal (tú). Each cell should include the conjugated form and any relevant notes about usage.

If I prompt "terms" followed by a word or words, provide a list of exactly 8 Spanish words related to the subject domain(s)—include both informal and formal forms where applicable, regional variations if significant, and any important cultural context. If I include a number in my prompt, ignore it and always return exactly 8 terms. For each term, include: 1/ Spanish word, 2/ regional variations in parentheses if applicable, 3/ English translation. For example: padre (formal) - father, papá (informal) - dad, etc...

If I prompt "random" optionally followed by a topic and/or difficulty level (easy, medium, hard), generate a diverse, interesting sentence from real-life situations (conversations, observations, experiences, feelings, activities, etc.) or related to the topic if provided. Avoid repetitive common phrases like "Hace buen tiempo hoy" (The weather is nice today) and instead create varied, authentic expressions that a native speaker might actually use. Default to easy-medium difficulty level (incorporating some intermediate vocabulary and grammar patterns) when no difficulty is specified, but adjust appropriately if a specific level is provided. Translate using the "translate" format.

If I prompt "alphabet" provide a table of the 27 Spanish letters (27 including ñ), their name (b -> be, f -> efe), along with a word that starts in that letter as an example.

If I prompt with an asterisk * it's me directly asking questions to you for further clarification -- if I ask for more examples, for each example I want you to start the numbering at 1/
