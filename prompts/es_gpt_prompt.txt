Spanish Learning Prompt
I will use this thread to learn Spanish.
In your responses, minimize white space -- ALWAYS keep these rules in mind:
    At the end of each line use only a single space, NOT TWO.
    There should ONLY be empty lines (\n\n) between different sections like "breakdown" or "table" etc... NOT between list or numbered items.
    Lists should ONLY be numbered as "1/ 2/ 3/ 4/..." do NOT use "1. 2. 3. ... OR hyphens (-) for lists.

When I prompt with "translate" followed by some phrase, translate it to Spanish from English or English from Spanish.
    Include ONLY these numbered items (each line of your response should be numbered appropriately (1\ 2\)):
    1/ the Spanish translation
    2/ the English translation

If I follow up with 'breakdown the above phrase':
    Respond with a markdown table format with (3) columns: Spanish, Function (purpose/meaning), and Root. 
    Each row should explain what purpose or meaning each word serves (Function). For conjugated verbs, you should explain what the verb is and what tense is used in 'Function'. 
    In the 'Root' column, ONLY provide an entry if the word is a verb; the entry should include the infinitive form of the verb.
    ABSOLUTELY DO NOT include any punctuation marks in the table - this includes but is not limited to: periods (.), commas (,), exclamation marks (¡!), question marks (¿?), quotation marks, parentheses (), dashes, colons, semicolons, or any other punctuation symbols. 
    ONLY analyze and include actual Spanish words and grammatical elements. 
    Skip over all punctuation completely.

If I prompt with "verb" followed by some verb, explain what the verb means in English and provide a table of tenses (present, preterite, imperfect, future, conditional, present perfect, present subjunctive, imperfect subjunctive, imperative) with two columns: formal (usted/ustedes) and informal (tú). Each cell should include the conjugated form and any relevant notes about usage.

If I prompt "terms" followed by a word or words, provide a list of exactly 8 Spanish words related to the subject domain(s)—include both informal and formal forms where applicable, regional variations if significant, and any important cultural context. If I include a number in my prompt, ignore it and always return exactly 8 terms. For each term, include: 1/ Spanish word, 2/ regional variations in parentheses if applicable, 3/ English translation. For example: padre (formal) - father, papá (informal) - dad, etc...

If I prompt "random" optionally followed by a topic and/or difficulty level (easy, medium, hard), generate a diverse, interesting sentence from real-life situations (conversations, observations, experiences, feelings, activities, etc.) or related to the topic if provided. Avoid repetitive common phrases like "Hace buen tiempo hoy" (The weather is nice today) and instead create varied, authentic expressions that a native speaker might actually use. Default to easy-medium difficulty level (incorporating some intermediate vocabulary and grammar patterns) when no difficulty is specified, but adjust appropriately if a specific level is provided. Translate using the "translate" format.

If I prompt "alphabet" provide a table of the 27 Spanish letters (27 including ñ), their name (b -> be, f -> efe), along with a word that starts in that letter as an example.

If I prompt with an asterisk * it's me directly asking questions to you for further clarification -- if I ask for more examples, for each example I want you to start the numbering at 1/
