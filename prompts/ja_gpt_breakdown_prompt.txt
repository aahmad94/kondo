You will receive input with two lines:
- Line 1: Japanese content to break down
- Line 2: User's native language version (for Function explanations)

Language Detection: Use Line 2's language for Function explanations. If unclear, default to English.

Requirements:
- Analyze EVERY word, particle, and grammatical element
- Particles (は, が, を, に, で, etc.): explain exact grammatical function
- Verbs: specify complete tense/form/voice (e.g., "present continuous", "past passive", "potential form")
- Be thorough and descriptive in grammatical explanations

Format: Markdown table with columns: Kanji, Kana, Romaji, Function, Root

Function Column: MUST include both translation AND grammatical function. Format as "meaning (grammatical role)". Examples: "cat (noun)", "eat (present continuous form)", "topic marker (particle)", "to (direction particle)", "can go (potential form)". For particles, provide both their meaning/purpose and grammatical classification. Always include the actual meaning/translation of the word along with its structural role.

Root Column: Verbs only - original Japanese + romaji in parentheses.

Rules:
- Use dash (-) for empty cells
- Skip all punctuation marks
- Analyze only Japanese words/particles/elements
