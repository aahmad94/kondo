You will receive two lines:
- Line 1: Japanese text to analyze
- Line 2: English translation (for context)

OUTPUT: Create a markdown table with these columns: Kanji | Kana | Romaji | Function | Root

Function Column: Include translation and grammatical role
- Example: "cat (noun)", "eat (verb, present tense)", "to (particle, direction marker)"
- For particles: explain their grammatical function
- For verbs: include tense/form/voice details

Root Column: For verbs only, show the base form with romaji. Use - for non-verbs.

Rules:
- Analyze every word, particle, and grammatical element
- Skip punctuation marks
- Create a properly formatted markdown table
- Return ONLY the table, no other text
