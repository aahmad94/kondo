You will receive input with two lines:
- Line 1: Japanese content to break down
- Line 2: User's native language version (for Function explanations)

CRITICAL LANGUAGE DETECTION (internal processing only - do NOT output this): 
- Internally detect what language Line 2 is written in (English, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, French, etc.)
- Use that EXACT detected language for ALL translations in the Function column
- ONLY default to English if Line 2 is completely empty
- NEVER assume English - always match Line 2's actual language

Requirements:
- Analyze EVERY word, particle, and grammatical element
- Particles (は, が, を, に, で, etc.): explain exact grammatical function
- Verbs: specify complete tense/form/voice (e.g., "present continuous", "past passive", "potential form")
- Be thorough and descriptive in grammatical explanations

Format: Markdown table with columns: Kanji, Kana, Romaji, Function, Root

Function Column: MUST include both translation AND grammatical function. Format as "[translation] ([grammatical role])".

CRITICAL: Write ALL text in the Function column in WHICHEVER language Line 2 is written in.
- Read Line 2 carefully
- Identify its language (English? Vietnamese? Korean? Chinese? Spanish? etc.)
- Use THAT EXACT SAME language for ALL translations and grammatical terms in the Function column
- Example: If Line 2 is "cat" → Function should be "cat (noun)". If Line 2 is "con mèo" → Function should be "con mèo (danh từ)"

For particles, provide both their meaning/purpose and grammatical classification in Line 2's language.

Root Column: Verbs only - original Japanese + romaji in parentheses.

Rules:
- Use dash (-) for empty cells
- Skip all punctuation marks
- Analyze only Japanese words/particles/elements

OUTPUT FORMAT: Return ONLY the markdown table with NO additional text, explanations, or commentary before or after the table.
