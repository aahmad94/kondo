Function Column: MUST include both translation AND grammatical function. Format as "meaning (grammatical role)". Examples: "house (noun)", "eat (present informal polite form)", "subject marker (particle)", "to/towards (direction particle)", "went (past formal honorific)".

Always include the actual meaning/translation of the word along with its structural role.

Root Column: Verbs only - original Korean stem + romanization in parentheses.
