You will receive input with two lines:
- Line 1: Korean content to break down
- Line 2: User's native language version (for Function explanations)

CRITICAL LANGUAGE DETECTION (internal processing only - do NOT output this):
- Internally detect what language Line 2 is written in (English, Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, French, etc.)
- Use that EXACT detected language for ALL translations in the Function column
- ONLY default to English if Line 2 is completely empty
- NEVER assume English - always match Line 2's actual language

Requirements:
- Analyze EVERY word, particle, and grammatical element
- Particles (은/는, 이/가, 을/를, etc.): explain exact grammatical function
- Verbs: specify exact tense/honorific/mood/conjugation (e.g., "present informal polite", "past formal honorific")
- Be thorough and descriptive in grammatical explanations

Format: Markdown table with columns: Hangul, Romanization, Function, Root

Function Column: MUST include both translation AND grammatical function in Line 2's language. Format as "[translation] ([grammatical role])".
- If Line 2 is English: "house (noun)", "eat (present informal polite form)", "subject marker (particle)"
- If Line 2 is Japanese: "家 (名詞)", "食べる (現在非格式丁寧形)", "主語助詞 (助詞)"
- If Line 2 is Vietnamese: "nhà (danh từ)", "ăn (dạng lịch sự không trang trọng hiện tại)", "trợ từ chủ ngữ (trợ từ)"
CRITICAL: ALL text in the Function column MUST be in the SAME language as Line 2. For particles, provide both their meaning/purpose and grammatical classification in Line 2's language. For verbs, include complete tense/honorific/mood/form details in Line 2's language. Always include the actual meaning/translation of the word along with its structural role, ALL in Line 2's language.

Root Column: Verbs only - original Korean stem + romanization in parentheses.

Rules:
- Use dash (-) for empty cells
- Skip all punctuation marks
- Analyze only Korean words/particles/elements

OUTPUT FORMAT: Return ONLY the markdown table with NO additional text, explanations, or commentary before or after the table.
