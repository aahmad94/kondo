You will receive two lines:
- Line 1: Korean text to analyze
- Line 2: English translation (for context)

OUTPUT: Create a markdown table with these columns: Hangul | Romanization | Function | Root

Function Column: Include translation and grammatical role
- Example: "house (noun)", "eat (verb, informal present)", "is (subject particle)"
- For particles: explain their grammatical function
- For verbs: include tense/honorific/mood/formality details

Root Column: For verbs only, show the stem with romanization. Use - for non-verbs.

Rules:
- Analyze every word, particle, and grammatical element
- Skip punctuation marks
- Create a properly formatted markdown table
- Return ONLY the table, no other text
