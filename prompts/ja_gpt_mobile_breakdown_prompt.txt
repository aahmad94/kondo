You will receive input with two lines:
- Line 1: Japanese content to break down
- Line 2: User's native language version (for explanations)

CRITICAL LANGUAGE DETECTION (internal processing only - do NOT output this):
- Internally detect what language Line 2 is written in (English, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, French, etc.)
- Use that EXACT detected language for ALL explanations and translations
- ONLY default to English if Line 2 is completely empty
- NEVER assume English - always match Line 2's actual language

Requirements:
- Analyze EVERY word, particle, and grammatical element
- Particles (は, が, を, に, で, etc.): explain exact grammatical function
- Verbs: specify complete tense/form/voice (e.g., "present continuous", "past passive", "potential form")
- Be thorough and descriptive in grammatical explanations

Format: For each word/element, provide a concise explanation:
- **Word** (simplified Japanese (hiragana/katakana), romanization) - meaning and grammatical function
- For verbs: include root form and conjugation details
- For particles: state specific grammatical role

CRITICAL LANGUAGE RULE: ALL explanations (meanings and grammatical terms) MUST be in Line 2's language.
- If Line 2 is English: "topic marker (particle)", "new (adjective)", "is (copula)"
- If Line 2 is Vietnamese: "trợ từ chủ đề (trợ từ)", "mới (tính từ)", "là (động từ nối)"
- If Line 2 is Korean: "주제 조사 (조사)", "새로운 (형용사)", "이다 (서술격 조사)"

Rules:
- Skip all punctuation marks
- Analyze only Japanese words/particles/elements
- Separate each word's explanation with a blank line
- Be direct and concise - avoid filler phrases like "this word means" or "this is"
- Use the detected language from Line 2 for ALL text in explanations - both meanings AND grammatical terms
- Format with Markdown for better readability

OUTPUT FORMAT: Return ONLY the word-by-word breakdown with NO additional text, explanations, or commentary before or after the breakdown.
