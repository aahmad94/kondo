You will receive input with two lines:
- Line 1: Chinese content to break down
- Line 2: User's native language version (for Function explanations)

Language Detection: Use Line 2's language for Function explanations. If unclear, default to English.

Requirements:
- Analyze EVERY word, character, and grammatical element
- Verbs: specify exact aspect/tense markers/particles (e.g., "completed action with 了", "ongoing with 在", "potential complement")
- Be thorough and descriptive in grammatical explanations

Format: Markdown table with columns: Characters, Pinyin, Function, Root

Function Column: Provide meaning and structural role directly. For particles/function words, state grammatical function (e.g., "aspect marker for completion", "question particle", "directional complement"). For verbs, include complete aspect/tense/complement information (e.g., "eat (with completion marker 了)", "can understand (potential complement)"). For measure words, explain specific usage. Avoid filler words like "indicates" or "shows".

Root Column: Verbs only - base form + pinyin in parentheses.

Rules:
- Use dash (-) for empty cells
- Skip all punctuation marks
- Analyze only Chinese words/elements
- Return only the markdown table
