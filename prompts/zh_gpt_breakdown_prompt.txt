You will receive two lines:
- Line 1: Chinese text to analyze
- Line 2: English translation (for context)

OUTPUT: Create a markdown table with these columns: Chars | Pinyin | Function | Root

Function Column: Include translation and grammatical role
- Example: "eat (verb)", "了 (particle, completion marker)", "的 (particle, possessive)"
- For verbs: include aspect/tense markers details
- For particles/function words: explain their grammatical role
- For measure words: specify usage context

Root Column: For verbs only, show the base form with pinyin. Use - for non-verbs.

Rules:
- Analyze every word, character, and grammatical element
- Skip punctuation marks
- Create a properly formatted markdown table
- Return ONLY the table, no other text
