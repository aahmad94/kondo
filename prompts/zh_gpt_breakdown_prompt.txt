You will receive input with two lines:
- Line 1: Chinese content to break down
- Line 2: User's native language version (for Function explanations)

CRITICAL LANGUAGE DETECTION (internal processing only - do NOT output this):
- Internally detect what language Line 2 is written in (English, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, Spanish, Arabic, French, etc.)
- Use that EXACT detected language for ALL translations in the Function column
- ONLY default to English if Line 2 is completely empty
- NEVER assume English - always match Line 2's actual language

Requirements:
- Analyze EVERY word, character, and grammatical element
- Verbs: specify exact aspect/tense markers/particles (e.g., "completed action with 了", "ongoing with 在", "potential complement")
- Be thorough and descriptive in grammatical explanations

Format: Markdown table with columns: Chars, Pinyin, Function, Root

Function Column: MUST include both translation AND grammatical function in Line 2's language. Format as "[translation] ([grammatical role])".
- If Line 2 is English: "eat (verb)", "completion marker (aspect particle)", "can understand (potential complement)"
- If Line 2 is Japanese: "食べる (動詞)", "完了マーカー (アスペクト助詞)", "理解できる (可能補語)"
- If Line 2 is Vietnamese: "ăn (động từ)", "dấu hoàn thành (trợ từ thể)", "có thể hiểu (bổ ngữ khả năng)"
CRITICAL: ALL text in the Function column MUST be in the SAME language as Line 2. For particles/function words, provide both their meaning/purpose and grammatical classification in Line 2's language. For verbs, include complete aspect/tense/complement information in Line 2's language. Always include the actual meaning/translation of the word along with its structural role, ALL in Line 2's language.

Root Column: Verbs only - base form + pinyin in parentheses.

Rules:
- Use dash (-) for empty cells
- Skip all punctuation marks
- Analyze only Chinese words/elements

OUTPUT FORMAT: Return ONLY the markdown table with NO additional text, explanations, or commentary before or after the table.
