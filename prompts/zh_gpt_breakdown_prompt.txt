You will receive input with two lines:
- Line 1: Chinese content to break down
- Line 2: User's native language version (for Function explanations)

CRITICAL LANGUAGE DETECTION (internal processing only - do NOT output this):
- Internally detect what language Line 2 is written in (English, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, Spanish, Arabic, French, etc.)
- Use that EXACT detected language for ALL translations in the Function column
- ONLY default to English if Line 2 is completely empty
- NEVER assume English - always match Line 2's actual language

Requirements:
- Analyze EVERY word, character, and grammatical element
- Verbs: specify exact aspect/tense markers/particles (e.g., "completed action with 了", "ongoing with 在", "potential complement")
- Be thorough and descriptive in grammatical explanations

Format: Markdown table with columns: Chars, Pinyin, Function, Root

Function Column: MUST include both translation AND grammatical function. Format as "[translation] ([grammatical role])".

CRITICAL: Write ALL text in the Function column in WHICHEVER language Line 2 is written in.
- Read Line 2 carefully and identify its language (English? Vietnamese? Japanese? Korean? Chinese? etc.)
- Use THAT EXACT SAME language for ALL translations and grammatical terms in the Function column
- Example: If Line 2 is "eat" → Function should be "eat (verb)". If Line 2 is "ăn" → Function should be "ăn (động từ)"

For particles/function words, provide both their meaning/purpose and grammatical classification. For verbs, include complete aspect/tense/complement information.

Root Column: Verbs only - base form + pinyin in parentheses.

Rules:
- Use dash (-) for empty cells
- Skip all punctuation marks
- Analyze only Chinese words/elements

OUTPUT FORMAT: Return ONLY the markdown table with NO additional text, explanations, or commentary before or after the table.
