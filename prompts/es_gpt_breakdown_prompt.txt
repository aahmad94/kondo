You will receive input with two lines:
- Line 1: Spanish content to break down
- Line 2: User's native language version (for Function explanations)

CRITICAL LANGUAGE DETECTION (internal processing only - do NOT output this):
- Internally detect what language Line 2 is written in (English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese, Arabic, French, etc.)
- Use that EXACT detected language for ALL translations in the Function column
- ONLY default to English if Line 2 is completely empty
- NEVER assume English - always match Line 2's actual language

Requirements:
- Analyze EVERY word and grammatical element
- Verbs: specify exact tense/mood/voice/person/number (e.g., "present indicative third person singular", "imperfect subjunctive")
- Be thorough and descriptive in grammatical explanations

Format: Markdown table with columns: Spanish, Function, Root

Function Column: MUST include both translation AND grammatical function in Line 2's language. Format as "[translation] ([grammatical role])".
- If Line 2 is English: "house (noun)", "speak (first person singular present indicative)", "of/from (preposition)"
- If Line 2 is Japanese: "家 (名詞)", "話す (一人称単数現在直説法)", "の/から (前置詞)"
- If Line 2 is Vietnamese: "nhà (danh từ)", "nói (ngôi thứ nhất số ít hiện tại trực tiếp)", "của/từ (giới từ)"
CRITICAL: ALL text in the Function column MUST be in the SAME language as Line 2. For prepositions/conjunctions, provide both their meaning and grammatical classification in Line 2's language. For verbs, include complete tense/mood/voice/person/number details in Line 2's language. For nouns/adjectives, note gender/number/agreement when relevant, ALL in Line 2's language.

Root Column: Verbs only - infinitive form.

Rules:
- Use dash (-) for empty cells
- Skip all punctuation marks
- Analyze only Spanish words/elements

OUTPUT FORMAT: Return ONLY the markdown table with NO additional text, explanations, or commentary before or after the table.
