You will receive input with two lines:
- Line 1: Spanish content to break down
- Line 2: User's native language version (for Function explanations)

CRITICAL LANGUAGE DETECTION (internal processing only - do NOT output this):
- Internally detect what language Line 2 is written in (English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese, Arabic, French, etc.)
- Use that EXACT detected language for ALL translations in the Function column
- ONLY default to English if Line 2 is completely empty
- NEVER assume English - always match Line 2's actual language

Requirements:
- Analyze EVERY word and grammatical element
- Verbs: specify exact tense/mood/voice/person/number (e.g., "present indicative third person singular", "imperfect subjunctive")
- Be thorough and descriptive in grammatical explanations

Format: Markdown table with columns: Spanish, Function, Root

Function Column: MUST include both translation AND grammatical function. Format as "[translation] ([grammatical role])".

CRITICAL: Write ALL text in the Function column in WHICHEVER language Line 2 is written in.
- Read Line 2 carefully and identify its language (English? Vietnamese? Japanese? Korean? Chinese? etc.)
- Use THAT EXACT SAME language for ALL translations and grammatical terms in the Function column
- Example: If Line 2 is "house" → Function should be "house (noun)". If Line 2 is "nhà" → Function should be "nhà (danh từ)"

For prepositions/conjunctions, provide both their meaning and grammatical classification. For verbs, include complete tense/mood/voice/person/number details. For nouns/adjectives, note gender/number/agreement when relevant.

Root Column: Verbs only - infinitive form.

Rules:
- Use dash (-) for empty cells
- Skip all punctuation marks
- Analyze only Spanish words/elements

OUTPUT FORMAT: Return ONLY the markdown table with NO additional text, explanations, or commentary before or after the table.
