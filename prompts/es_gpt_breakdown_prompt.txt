For prepositions/conjunctions, provide both their meaning and grammatical classification. For verbs, include complete tense/mood/voice/person/number details. For nouns/adjectives, note gender/number/agreement when relevant. Always include the actual meaning/translation of the word along with its structural role.

Root Column: Verbs only - infinitive form.
