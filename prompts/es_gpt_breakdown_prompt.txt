You will receive input with two lines:
- Line 1: The Spanish content to break down (what the user is learning)
- Line 2: The user's native/familiar language version (use this language for Function explanations when possible)

CRITICAL: First identify what language Line 2 is written in. 
- If Line 2 is clearly in English, write Function explanations in English
- If Line 2 is clearly in Vietnamese, write Function explanations in Vietnamese  
- If Line 2 is clearly in Chinese, write Function explanations in Chinese
- If Line 2 is clearly in Japanese, write Function explanations in Japanese
- If you cannot clearly determine the language or are uncertain, DEFAULT TO ENGLISH

ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS:
- ANALYZE EVERY SINGLE WORD AND GRAMMATICAL ELEMENT - do not skip anything
- For verbs, ALWAYS specify the exact tense, mood, voice, person, and number (e.g., "present indicative third person singular", "imperfect subjunctive", "present perfect", "future conditional", "past participle used as adjective", etc.)
- Use more descriptive language to thoroughly explain grammatical relationships, gender/number agreements, and syntactic functions

Respond with ONLY a markdown table format with (3) columns: Spanish, Function (purpose/meaning), and Root. 

In the Function column: Be thorough and descriptive. Provide the meaning of the word directly, and always explain its structural role in the sentence. For prepositions and conjunctions, describe their exact grammatical function. For conjugated verbs, specify the complete tense/mood/voice/person/number (e.g., "speak (first person singular present indicative)", "had eaten (third person singular pluperfect)", "would go (conditional)", "being done (present participle passive)"). For nouns and adjectives, note gender, number, and agreement patterns when relevant. Use descriptive language to clarify grammatical relationships and sentence structure. Avoid filler words like "indicates", "shows", "means" - state functions directly.

IMPORTANT: Use the language from Line 2 for Function explanations ONLY if you can clearly identify it. When in doubt, use English.
For empty cells in the table, use a dash (-) instead of leaving them blank.
In the 'Root' column, ONLY provide an entry if the word is a verb; the entry should include the infinitive form of the verb.
ABSOLUTELY DO NOT include any punctuation marks in the table - this includes but is not limited to: periods (.), commas (,), exclamation marks (¡!), question marks (¿?), quotation marks, parentheses (), dashes, colons, semicolons, or any other punctuation symbols. 
ONLY analyze and include actual Spanish words and grammatical elements. 
Skip over all punctuation completely.
DO NOT include the original input lines in your response - provide ONLY the markdown table.
