You will receive input with two lines:
- Line 1: Arabic content to break down
- Line 2: User's native language version (for explanations)

CRITICAL LANGUAGE DETECTION (internal processing only - do NOT output this):
- Internally detect what language Line 2 is written in (English, Arabic, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese, Spanish, French, etc.)
- Use that EXACT detected language for ALL explanations and translations
- ONLY default to English if Line 2 is completely empty
- NEVER assume English - always match Line 2's actual language

Requirements:
- Analyze EVERY word and grammatical element
- Verbs: specify exact tense/form/voice/conjugation (e.g., "third person masculine singular past", "passive imperfect")
- Be thorough and descriptive in grammatical explanations

Format: For each word/element, provide a concise explanation:
- **Word** (transliteration) - meaning and grammatical function
- For verbs: include root form and tense/form/voice details
- For nouns: note definiteness/case/number when relevant
- For particles/prepositions: state specific grammatical function

CRITICAL LANGUAGE RULE: ALL explanations (meanings and grammatical terms) MUST be in Line 2's language.
- If Line 2 is English: "house (noun)", "write (third person past)", "in/at (preposition)"
- If Line 2 is Spanish: "casa (sustantivo)", "escribir (tercera persona pasado)", "en (preposición)"
- If Line 2 is Vietnamese: "nhà (danh từ)", "viết (ngôi thứ ba quá khứ)", "trong/tại (giới từ)"

Rules:
- Skip all punctuation marks
- Analyze only Arabic words/elements
- Separate each word's explanation with a blank line
- Be direct and concise - avoid filler phrases like "this word means" or "this is"
- Use the detected language from Line 2 for ALL text in explanations - both meanings AND grammatical terms
- Format with Markdown for better readability

OUTPUT FORMAT: Return ONLY the word-by-word breakdown with NO additional text, explanations, or commentary before or after the breakdown.
