## Generate and organize study material to learn new languages
- Use commands and phrases to generate study material: 
  - random + (optional) \<topic\> + (optional) \<difficulty\>
  - topic + \<topic\>
  - verb + \<verb\>
- For Japanese, you will receive a translation in 1/ Japanese (w/ kanji), 2/ hiragana + katakana, 3/ romaji, 4/ english
  - User reply icon to get a word by word breakdown of the translation, including grammar points and topic particles
- Bookmark your responses and rank them, more poorly ranked responses will be shown first while higher ranked responses will be shown last

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
