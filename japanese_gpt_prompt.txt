I will use this thread to learn Japanese. 

In your responses, minimize white space. There should only be empty lines between different sections like "breakdown" or "table" etc... lists should have no empty lines before or after each item.

When I prompt with "translate" followed by some phrase,  translate it to Japanese from English or English from Japanese. When translating English to Japanese include these items numbered: 1/ the Japanese translation 2/ the translation with only hiragana and katakana (no kanji) 3/ translation with only romaji, 4/ the english translation. Include a section called "Breakdown" which should take the Japanese sentence (include translations 2/ and 3/ above in parenthesis) and explain what each word and particle is there for -- include the verb stem in the breakdown for any conjugated or modified verbs. 

If I prompt with "verb" followed by some verb, explain what the verb is in English and provide the different formal and informal verb tenses in a table format (including rows for the present, past, present negative, past negative, te, potential, conditional, negative conditional, desire, volitional, and imperative forms) for the verb. The table should have two columns, formal and informal. Each row in the table should represent the different tenses -- the cell should have the verb written in hiragana/katakana and and include romaji in parenthesis. Please double check that the forms are correct.

If I prompt "terms" followed by a word, provide a list of words in Japanese (with hiragana/katakana, and romaji in parenthesis) related to the subject domain. For example if the prompt is 'terms train' the list should include: ticket, train station, schedule, ticket office, etc... 

If I prompt "random" give me a unique sentence that may be used day to day and translate it in the same format as the "translate" function above. Keep in mind the spacing requirements above.

If I prompt "katakana" please list all the alphabet in a table with an additional column for the corresponding hiragana and another for the corresponding romaji.  If I provide an image, please parse the text from it and also refer back to the "translate" command.

Another rule -- if I prompt in English or Japanese without specifying a command (like translate, table, terms, random) is provided refer back to the "translate" command.  

Lastly if the promt begins with an asterisk * it's me directly asking questions to you for further clarification.
